      <h2 class="heading">Step 1: Constructing Boolean Expressions</h2>
      <p>This is the first step in the development of the Birthday Circuit. 
        I began by constructing a truth table with 3 inputs (denoted as X, Y, and Z). 
        After this, I set 7 outputs, corresponding to the 7 segments of the 7-segment display. 
        The digits used in my birthday are '-', '0', and '1'. 
        After constructing a general truth table, I constructed individual truth tables for each of the letters in the 7-segment display. 
        These tables were then k-mapped in order to extract the simplified Boolean expression. 
        Finally, the Boolean expressions for each of the letters were constructed. 
        (Note that my birthday, 01-11-10, happens to be in binary with only 3 possible digits, so most of these expressions will be unnecessary in the code, as the other segments can be derived based upon the values of simply a and b)

      <h2 class="heading">Step 2: Arduino Nano with Switches</h2>

      <p> After constructing the boolean expressions, it was time to code the arduino nano.
          This invovled reading the 3 inputs from pins 10, 11, and 12 (I connected these to the switches on the trainer).
          Then, I proceeded to make the outputs, by writing the boolean expressions in the void loop along with conditionals.
          The output pins (3 -> 8) were then connected to the corresponding letters on the display. Using this setup, 
          I could switch the switches in order from 000 all the way to 111 
          and display the digits of my birthday in the correct order.

      <h2 class="heading">Step 3: Using the pulse switch for Input Signals</h2>
      <p> Now that the hardware was working with inputs from the switches, 
          I modified the circuit to work with the pulse switch. 
          This also required the 74193 counter IC. The three outputs on this IC were connected to pins 10, 11, 12 (inputs to the Nano). 
          The input to the IC was then connected to the pulse switch, 
          while the 'Clear' input on the IC was connected to a separate input switch turned off at the moment. 
          (This switch resets my birthday back to 0 after it has been completed).

    <div class="text"> 
      <h2 class="heading">Step 4: 555 Timer and Potentiometer for Input</h2>
      <p> This was by far the most challenging step, as multiple new components were introduced. 
          A battery, potentiometer, 555 timer IC, a capacitor, along with a resistor was added. 
          Rather than the input signal from the pulse switch, now the input signal was to come from the 555 timer to the counter IC. 
          'Clear' was also set to ground. The battery was now used to supply power to the breadboard and arduino rather than the trainer.
          A major challenge was debugging, as the number often remained stagnant and didn't alter due to capacitance or resistance of the added units. 
          Finally, with this setup, the circuit can display my birthday at varying speeds, set by the potentiometer.

      <h2 class="heading">Step 5: Neatness</h2>
      <p> Finally after having completed the circuit, I had to ensure it was neat. 
          This meant that there shouldn't have been any crossing wires or bridges. 
          Naturally, along the way, certain connections were altered and I had to repeatedly debug. 
          Here is a picture of the final product:

  <section id="reflection" class="card">
    <div class="text"> 
      <h2 class="heading">Reflection</h2>
      <p> This process tied in elements of what we learned from the entire unit. 
          From translating the problem into truth tables and K-maps, to wiring the final circuit, 
          the entire process gave me good hands-on practice. If I could do one thing differently, that would be to 
          try different components first prior to repeatedly trying to find errors with wiring. 
          This is because, oftentimes, I was simply stuck on a step because one of the parts of a component was fried. There was a time
          when I finished part 4 (along with neatness) to the point where it was working 2 days prior to the due date. 
          Just when I was ready to submit my circuit for that step, the numbers suddenly started flickering, and appearing out of order. 
          The days leading up to the due date, the circuit only got worse and worse, with no one able to find a mistake. 
          Ultimately, I rebuilt the entire 555 timer and potentiometer section using a logic probe to find it to start working once again. 
          This taught me that oftentimes with circuits, when nothing seems to fix the issue, sometimes it may be wise to build it back up again from scratch.
          Aside from that, it was a good experience developing the Birthday Circuit.
